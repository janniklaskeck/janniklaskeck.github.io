FlatWave is a simple and short FPS I developed during one month as an exercise.

It includes three different weapons with two fire modes each, three different enemy types and one short level.

Most of the assets used were created by me, with the exceptions of sound/music, some textures and the font.
I used hacknPlan to organize my work and plan possible game features.
Most of the gameplay was programmed in C++, with UI and some minor functions being done in Blueprints.

Below you can see some screenshots as well as a short video of a playthrough.
